================================
>A ES6 (Babel) yeoman generator.

This is a simple generator for convert ES6 files to ES5, also convert SASS files to CSS and reloads the browser page if there is any change.

Languages									| Other features:

`ECMASCRIPT6`  `SASS`  `[LODASH]`  `[JQUERY]` | `Browser live reload`  `Uglify`  `HTML minimify`

## Requirements
* [Node](https://nodejs.org)
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
* [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/)

## Installation
To install the generator:

`npm install -g generator-es6power`

You need to have node, grunt, yo and bower installed globally before running the command. Therefore download node from the link and run:

`npm install -g yo gulp`

### Scaffold an application
Scaffolding a ES6 application works like every other Yeoman generator. If you have the generator installed, cd to an empty project directory and run:

`gulp`
